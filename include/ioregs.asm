; $ff10 - $ff3f are sound registers:

; Channel 1 Sweep register. Controls frequency sweeps.
; Bits 0-2 control how much it changes each step. According to bgb docs, it changes by old freq / 2^n
; where n is this number 0-7. However, experiments with bgb show that no sweep occurs if n = 0.
; Bit 3 controls increasing (0) or decreasing (1) frequency.
; Bits 4-6 select sweep time, or 0 to disable sweep. bgb docs get confusing here but it seems
; roughly like step frequency = 128/n Hz where n is this number 1-7.

; "LCDC" LCD control register. Defaults to $91. Write to these bits to control the display mode:
; 0: Background and Window display off/on

; area ($fe00-$fe9f). While this is happening, only high ram ($ff80-$fffe) can be used.
; DMA transfer is initiated by writing the upper byte of the start source address to this register.
